            <section class="section" id="about">
		<p>Argument Mining (also known as “argumentation mining”) is an emerging research area within computational linguistics that started with focusing on automatically identifying and classifying argument elements, covering several text genres such as legal documents, news articles, online debates, scholarly data, and many more. In recent years, the field (broadly Computational Argumentation) has grown to explore argument quality and synthesis on many levels. The field offers practical uses such as argument-focused search and debating technologies, e.g., IBM Project Debater. The growing interest in computational argumentation has led to several tutorials at major NLP conferences.</p>
               
                <p>While basic tasks such as argument element segmentation and classification are becoming mature, many current and emerging tasks in diverse genres and topics still need to be solved, amidst global polarization and the emergence of Large Language Models.</p>

            <h3>Submission Details</h3>
           <p> The organizing committee welcomes submitting long papers, short papers, and demo descriptions. Accepted papers will be presented via oral or poster presentations and included in the ACL proceedings as workshop papers.</p>
           <ul><li><b> Long paper </b> submissions must describe substantial, original, completed, and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Long papers must be at most eight pages, including title, text, figures, and tables. An unlimited number of pages is allowed for references. Two additional pages are allowed for appendices, and an extra page is allowed in the final version to address reviewers’ comments.</li>
           <li><b> Short paper</b> submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead, short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages, such as a small, focused contribution, a negative result, or an interesting application nugget. Short papers must be at most four pages, including title, text, figures, and tables. An unlimited number of pages is allowed for references. One additional page is allowed for the appendix, and an extra page is allowed in the final version to address reviewers’ comments.</li>
           <li><b> Demo papers</b> must be at most four pages, including title, text, examples, figures, tables, and references. A separate one-page document should be provided to the workshop organizers for demo descriptions, specifying furniture and equipment needed for the demo.</li></ul>


<h4>Multiple Submissions</h4>
ArgMining 2024 will not consider any paper under review in a journal or another conference or workshop at the time of submission, and submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere during the review period.

ArgMining 2024 will also accept submissions of ARR-reviewed papers, provided that the ARR reviews and meta-reviews are available by the ARR commitment deadline (<b>April 15</b>). However, ArgMining 2024 will not accept direct submissions that are actively under review in ARR, or that overlap significantly (>25%) with such submissions.

<h4>Submission Format</h4>
All long, short, and demonstration submissions must follow the two-column ACL 2024 format. Authors are expected to use the <a  href="https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files" target="_blank">LaTeX or Microsoft Word style template</a>. Submissions must be electronic and in PDF format.


<h4>Submission Link</h4>

Authors have to fill in the submission form in the OpenReview system and upload a PDF of their paper <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2024/Workshop/ArgMining" target="_blank">here</a> before <b>May 17, 2024, 11:59 pm UTC-12h (anywhere on earth)</b>. [ <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2024/Workshop/ArgMining" target="_blank">Submission Link</a>]

<h4>Double Blind Review</h4>
ArgMining 2024 will follow the <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php/ACL_Policies_for_Review_and_Citation" target="_blank">ACL policies</a> preserving the integrity of double-blind review for long and short paper submissions. Papers must not include authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references or links (such as GitHub) that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers. For example, do not omit or redact important citation information to preserve anonymity. Instead, use the third person or named reference to this work, as described above (“Smith showed” rather than “we showed”). Papers may be accompanied by a resource (software and/or data) described in the paper, but these resources should also be anonymized.
Unlike long and short papers, demo descriptions will not be anonymous. Demo descriptions should include the authors’ names and affiliations, and self-references are allowed.

<br/>
<b>No Anonimity Period</b> <small><i>(taken from the ACL call for papers in verbatim for the most part)</i></small>
There is no anonymity period or limitation on posting or discussing non-anonymous preprints while the work is under peer review.


<h4>Best Paper Award</h4>
In order to recognize significant advancements in argument mining science and technology, ArgMining 2024 will include the Best Paper award. All papers at the workshop are eligible for the best paper award, and a selection committee consisting of prominent researchers in the fields of interest will select the award recipients.

            <h2>Shared Tasks</h2> 
     <P>The Argument Miming Workshop will be hosting two shared tasks.</P>
    
     <h3>1. The Perspective Argument Retrieval Shared Task</h3>
     <p><b>Organizers : </b>Neele Falk from the University of Stuttgart, and Andreas Waldis from the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Technical University of Darmstadt, and Infomration System Lab, Lucerne University of Applied Science and Arts.</p> 
     <p><b>Overview: </b>The "Perspective Argument Retrieval" task addresses the often-overlooked challenge of incorporating socio-demographic information (such as political views, age, and gender) in argument retrieval. By focusing on these aspects, we acknowledge their potential latent influence on argumentation. With this shared task, we invite the community to develop methods that concentrate on this crucial area and advance state-of-the-art retrieval models by considering the perspective of societal diversity. </p>


     <h3>2. DialAM-2024: The First Shared Task on Dialogical Argument Mining</h3>
     <p><b>Organizers:</b> Ramon Ruiz-Dolz, John Lawrence, Ella Schad and Chris Reed from the Centre for Argument Technology in the University of Dundee.</p>
     
<p><b>Overview: </b>With the DialAM-2024 task, we propose the first shared task in dialogue argument mining where argumentation and dialogue information is modelled together in a domain-independent framework. The Inference Anchoring Theory (IAT) framework, makes possible to obtain homogeneous annotations of dialogue argumentation including relevant information and structural data from speech and argumentation, regardless of the domain, and allowing a more complete analysis of argumentation in dialogues together with a consistent cross-domain evaluation of the resulting argument mining systems. The DialAM-2024 consists of two sub-tasks: the identification of propositional (argumentative) relations, and the identification of illocutionary (speech act) relations. For both tasks all the information belonging to argumentation and dialogue will be available for the development of the submitted systems. We invite the community to participate in the DialAM-2024 task and explore how the use of additional information from the dialogue can be integrated into the argument mining process, in an attempt to take a step forward from sequence modelling approaches, where much of the relevant information to argumentation remains implicit behind the natural language.</p>
<ul><li><b>Task 1: Identification of Propositional Relations:</b> In the first task, the goal is to detect argumentative relations existing between the propositions identified and segmented in the argumentative dialogue. Such relations are: Inference (RA), Confclict (CA), and Rephrase (MA).</li>

    <li><b>Task 2: Identification of Illocutionary Relation:</b>In the second task, the goal is to detect illocutionary relations existing between locutions uttered in the dialogue and and the argumentative propositions associated with them such as: Asserting, Agreeing, Arguing, or Disagreeing among others.</li>
</ul>

				<p>MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS:</p>
				<p>ArgMining 2024 will not consider any paper that is under review in a journal or another conference or workshop at the time of submission, and submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere during the review period. ArgMining 2024 will also accept submissions of ARR-reviewed papers, provided that the ARR reviews and meta-reviews are available by the ARR commitment deadline (September 15). However, ArgMining 2024 will not accept direct submissions that are actively under review in ARR, or that overlap significantly (&gt;25%) with such submissions.</p>
				<br>
				<p>SUBMISSION FORMAT AND LINK:</p>
				<p>All long, short, and demonstration submissions must follow the two-column ACL 2024 format. Authors are expected to use the LaTeX or Microsoft Word style template (<a href="https://2024.acl.org/calls/style-and-formatting/">https://2024.acl.org/calls/style-and-formatting/</a>. Submissions must conform to the official ACL style guidelines, which are contained in these templates. Submit your paper in PDF format via <a href="https://softconf.com/acl2024/ArgMining2024/">https://softconf.com/acl2024/ArgMining2024/</a>.</p>
				<p><b>If you want to commit your ARR paper to the workshop, fill in the ARR form via <a href="https://softconf.com/acl2024/ArgMining2024/">https://softconf.com/acl2024/ArgMining2024/</a>.</b></p>
				<br>
				<p>DOUBLE BLIND REVIEW:</p>
				<p>ArgMining 2024 will follow the ACL policies for preserving the integrity of double-blind review for long and short paper submissions. Papers must not include authors’ names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references or links (such as github) that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers. For example, do not omit or redact important citation information to preserve anonymity. Instead, use third person or named reference to this work, as described above (“Smith showed” rather than “we showed”). If important citations are not available to reviewers (e.g., awaiting publication), these paper/s should be anonymised and included in the appendix. They can then be referenced from the submission without compromising anonymity. Papers may be accompanied by a resource (software and/or data) described in the paper, but these resources should also be anonymized. <b>Unlike long and short papers, demo descriptions will not be anonymous.</b> Demo descriptions should include the authors’ names and affiliations, and self-references are allowed.</p> 			 
				<br>
				<p>ANONYMITY PERIOD (taken from the ACL call for papers in verbatim for the most part):</p>
				<p>The following rules and guidelines are meant to protect the integrity of double-blind review and ensure that submissions are reviewed fairly. The rules make reference to the anonymity period, which runs from 1 month before the direct submission deadline (starting TODO) up to the date when your paper is accepted or rejected (TODO). For papers committed from ARR, the anonymity period starts TODO. Papers that are withdrawn during this period will no longer be subject to these rules. You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available online to the general community (for example, via a preprint server) during the anonymity period. Versions of the paper include papers having essentially the same scientific content but possibly differing in minor details (including title and structure) and/or in length. If you have posted a non-anonymized version of your paper online before the start of the anonymity period, you may submit an anonymized version to the conference. The submitted version must not refer to the non-anonymized version, and you must inform the programme chairs that a non-anonymized version exists. You may not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period. You may make an anonymized version of your paper available (for example, on OpenReview), even during the anonymity period. For arXiv submissions, TODO 11:59pm UTC-12h (anywhere on earth) is the latest time the paper can be uploaded if you plan a direct submission to the workshop (or TODO for papers from ARR committed to the workshops on TODO).</p>
				<br>
				<p>BEST PAPER AWARDS:</p>
				<p>In order to recognize significant advancements in argument mining science and technology, ArgMining 2024 will include best paper awards. All papers at the workshop are eligible for the best paper awards and a selection committee consisting of prominent researchers in the fields of interest will select the recipients of the awards.</p>
