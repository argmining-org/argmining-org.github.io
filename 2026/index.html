            <section class="section" id="about">
		      <p><b>Argument mining</b> (also known as "argumentation mining") is a well-established research area in computational linguistics that focuses on the automatic identification of argumentative structures, such as premises, conclusions, and inference schemes. Since its beginnings, the focus has been on the development of large-scale argumentation dataset and tasks like argument quality assessment, argument persuasiveness, and the synthesis of argumentative texts, spanning various domains, such as legal, social, medical, political, and scientific settings.</p>
              <p>Mirroring the advancements in CL and NLP at large, argument mining has started to work on explainable argumentation, mulitmodal settings, and modeling human label variation. The field has also started to investigate the performance of generative models in producing and analyzing human-like argumentation. The quality of those models depends heavily on the task; for instance, LLMs show strong performance in generating persuasive essay and convincing arguments, but they have shown to fall short in identifying fallacious arguments and reproduce biases inherent in models, requiring substantial fine-tuning efforts to mitigate them. It remains largely unexplored whether LLMs truly possess a deeper understanding of argumentation, or if they are simply effective pattern learners.</p> 
              <p><b>The 2026 edition of the ArgMining workshop therefore places a special focus on understanding and evaluating arguments in both human and machine reasoning.</b> With this topic, we broaden the workshop's focus to include <i>reasoning</i>, a long-standing area of research in AI that has recently gained renewed interest within the *ACL community, driven by the latest generation of LLMs. Reasoning is tightly connected to argumentation as it represents, analyzes and evaluates the process of reaching conclusions on the basis of available information. If we consider argumentation as a paradigm to capture reasoning, then machines (particularly LLMs) can be evaluated based on their ability to address argument mining tasks.</p>

              <p>The workshop will be co-located with ACL 2026 and held in San Diego, United States in a hybrid format. </p>

                </ul>
            <p>We welcome submissions from all areas of application.</p>

            <h3>Submission Details.</h3>
            <p>The organizing committee welcomes submitting long papers, short papers, extended abstracts and PhD proposals. Accepted papers will be presented via oral or poster presentations. Long and short papers will be included in the ACL proceedings as workshop papers. Extended abstracts and PhD proposals will be non-archival.</p>

            <h3>Archival submissions.</h3>
            <p>Long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed, and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Long papers must be at most eight pages, including title, text, figures, and tables. An unlimited number of pages is allowed for references. Two additional pages are allowed for appendices, and an extra page is allowed in the final version to address reviewers’ comments.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead, short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages, such as a small, focused contribution, a negative result, or an interesting application nugget. Short papers must be at most four pages, including title, text, figures, and tables. An unlimited number of pages is allowed for references. One additional page is allowed for the appendix, and an extra page is allowed in the final version to address reviewers’ comments.</p>
        
            <h3>Non-Archival submissions.</h3>
            <p>Extended abstracts must be at most two pages including references and an additional page as an appendix for tables/figures describing ongoing projects, interesting pieces of data or results, or already published work. While selecting the abstracts, we will keep two constraints in mind: a) Fit to the workshop, in particular to the special theme "Argument Mining and Reasoning"; b) Priority to papers with doctoral students as 1st authors that could not be presented at a *CL conference due to visa restrictions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>PhD proposals must describe PhD projects being or to be developed within the broad field of natural language argumentation processing. PhD proposals must be at most four pages including the main research directions or challenges being investigated, the specific contributions made (on the research direction), and the directions for the remaining work. A dedicated poster session will be hosted, allowing students to get feedback and discuss their work with a broad and multidisciplinary community.</p>
        
            <h3>Multiple Submissions.</h3>
            <p>ArgMining 2026 will not consider any paper under review in a journal or another conference or workshop at the time of submission, and submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere during the review period.</p>
            <br>
            <p>ArgMining 2026 will accept submissions of ARR-reviewed papers, provided that the ARR reviews and meta-reviews are available by the ARR commitment deadline. However, ArgMining 2026 will not accept direct submissions that are actively under review in ARR, or that overlap significantly (>25%) with such submissions.</p>
        
            <h3>Submission Format.</h3>
            <p>All long, short, and demonstration submissions must follow the two-column ACL 2026 <a  target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Lilaizhen/acl2026">https://github.com/Lilaizhen/acl2026</a> format. Authors are expected to use the LaTeX or Microsoft Word style template LaTeX or Microsoft Word style template. Submissions must conform to the official ACL style guidelines contained in these templates. Submissions must be electronic and in PDF format.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Submissions must be made through the OpenReview system.</p>

            <h3>Double Blind Review.</h3>
            <p>ArgMining 2026 will follow the ACL policies preserving the integrity of double-blind review for long and short paper submissions. Papers must not include authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references or links (such as GitHub) that reveal the author’s identity, e.g., “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Papers should not refer, for further detail, to documents that are not available to the reviewers. For example, do not omit or redact important citation information to preserve anonymity. Instead, use the third person or named reference to this work, as described above (“Smith showed” rather than “we showed”). Papers may be accompanied by a resource (software and/or data) described in the paper, but these resources should also be anonymized. Unlike long and short papers, demo descriptions will not be anonymous. Demo descriptions should include the authors’ names and affiliations, and self-references are allowed.</p>
        
            <h3>Anonymity Period</h3>
            <p>We follow the ACL Policies for Review and Citation. Submissions must be anonymized, but there is no anonymity period or limitation on posting or discussing non-anonymous preprints while the work is under peer review.</p>
            
            <h3>Best Paper Award.</h3>
            <p>In order to recognize significant advancements in argument mining science and technology, ArgMining 2026 will include the Best Paper award. All papers at the workshop are eligible for the best paper award, and a selection committee consisting of prominent researchers in the fields of interest will select the award recipients.</p>

            <h2>CALL FOR SHARED TASKS PROPOSALS</h2>

                <p>We cordially invite submissions of shared tasks as part of ArgMining 2026.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To advance research on specific aspects of argument mining, previous editions of the ArgMining workshop series have promoted 
                    shared tasks. These have addressed, for example, multimodal argumentative fallacy detection 
                    (see <a href="https://nlp-unibo.github.io/mm-argfallacy/2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://nlp-unibo.github.io/mm-argfallacy/2025/</a>) 
                    and dialogical argument mining 
                    (see <a href="http://dialam.arg.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://dialam.arg.tech/</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following the success of previous workshops, ArgMining 2026 plans to share one or more unsolved problems to be investigated 
                    by the community. In keeping with this year's special topic of <em>Understanding and evaluating arguments in both human and machine reasoning</em>, 
                    we particularly encourage submissions that focus on this theme.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Proposals for shared tasks should include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A title and a brief description of the task.</li>
                    <li>A description of the datasets that will be used in the task and their readiness.</li>
                    <li>Previous work on the datasets, including publications (if any).</li>
                    <li>A short description of how submitted systems will be evaluated.</li>
                    <li>A brief introduction of the task organizers.</li>
                    <li>An anticipated timeline and dates for releasing datasets and conducting the final evaluation.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Please submit your shared task proposal via email to <a href="mailto:argmining.org@gmail.com" target="_blank">argmining.org@gmail.com</a>. 
                    The submission deadline is <strong>December 22, 2025</strong>, and task organizers will be notified of acceptance in 
                    early to mid-January 2026.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>We assume the following tentative schedule:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mid-January – Training data release</li>
